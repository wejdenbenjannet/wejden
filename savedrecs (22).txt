AB Central bank characteristics are important determinants of stock market returns and their volatility. While the literature has examined the effects of transparency and independence, no research has been conducted so far on the effect of central bank credibility on stock market returns' volatility. A panel regression using financial and macroeconomic data from 45 OECD member countries over the period of 1998-2022 tested the hypothesis that central bank credibility determines stock exchange returns' volatility. The results indicated that credibility reduces stock returns' volatility, remaining robust and statistically significant across models. Economic growth also decreases stock market volatility, while money-market interest rates' volatility, the stock market's turnover ratio, and economic/financial crises act as amplifying factors of stock market volatility. All variables, except for economic growth, exhibit unidirectional causality, leading to changes in stock market volatility.

AB This study examines, through a panel data analysis for 114 developing countries, the exchange rate pass-through on inflation and on its volatility and, in particular, how the central bank credibility affects this relationship. Based on the idea that credibility can be measured by the difference between the policymaker's plans and the public's beliefs about those plans, several indicators were built. The findings denote that central bank credibility is able to more than counteract the bad effects on inflation caused by the exchange rate pass-through and thus contribute to greater price stability in developing economies. In brief, for the case of monetary authorities committed to anchor inflation expectations there is a gain of credibility that works as a tool to eliminate the pass-through effect on inflation.

AB This paper examines the effects of quantitative easing (QE) announcements by the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England on exchange rate dynamics. Using intraday data of three major exchange rates (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD), we apply a univariate APARCH(1,1) model and include QE dummies to empirically investigate how exchange rates are affected in mean and volatility. The empirical results indicate: (i) a direct negative impact on GBP and JPY and no effect of their volatility around the QE announcements of the corresponding central banks, (ii) a delayed devaluation of EUR and an increase of its volatility before and after the ECB's announcements. Furthermore, the behavior of dynamic conditional correlation among currencies is investigated across the QE announcements. We find a decline in the conditional correlation between EUR and GBP around the announcements by the BoE. These findings highlight the differences on the credibility and effectiveness of the monetary easing strategies and provide important implications from the investors and policy makers perspective.

AB Against the backdrop that inflation targeting is adopted to achieve a stable macroeconomy (i.e. achieve single-digit inflation rates, lock-in of inflation expectations, and the capacity to deal with demand shocks and financial crises), we analyse the credibility of the Ghanaian and South African Central Banks in achieving target inflation rates. Further, we test the extent to which foreign direct investment, trade openness, and exchange rate volatility moderate the effect of central bank credibility on economic growth and output volatility in Ghana and South Africa. Using the GMM estimation technique, we find robust evidence that weakened central bank credibility is directly inimical to economic growth in both countries but more pronounced in South Africa. Further, the evidence suggests that although missing inflation target triggers output volatility in both countries, the effect is remarkable in the case of South Africa. Additionally, the study reveals that while trade openness and FDI nullify the harmful effect of missed inflation target on economic growth in South Africa, that effect proves elusive in the case of Ghana. We provide recommendations in the light of the weak economic prospects and the projected rise in financial globalisation of both countries following the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

AB Regaining exchange rate stability has been a major monetary policy goal of East Asian countries in the aftermath of the 1997/98 currency crisis. While most countries have abstained from re-establishing a formal US Dollar peg, they have typically managed the US Dollar exchange rate de facto. We show that most of these countries were able to regain their monetary credibility within a relatively short time period. The Argentine crisis in 2001 caused a minor setback in this process for some countries. We measure the credibility of monetary policy by separating the fundamental and excess volatility of the exchange rate on the basis of a chartist-fundamentalist model. The degree of excess volatility is interpreted as the ability of the central bank to manage the exchange rate via the coordination channel. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Whether or not inflation targeting adoption leads to increased volatility of exchange rates is controversial. The volatility increases with inflation targeting as a result of the flexible exchange rate regime. Others argue that inflation targeting delivers the best outcomes in terms of lower exchange rate volatility. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether interest rate policy in inflation targeting frameworks - that is subjected to control inflation rate may reduce the volatility of exchange rates. To test the hypothesis, we use monthly data in the case of Indonesia over the period 2005(7)-2016(7). Several control variables are introduced in the regressions. The result of the autoregressive distributed lag model proves the interest rate policy and foreign exchange intervention fail to reduce the exchange rates volatility. It seems inflation targeting in Indonesia puts too much emphasis on stabilizing the domestic currency thus leading to benign neglect of stabilizing its external value, ultimately resulting in increased exchange rate volatility. These findings suggest that central bank credibility plays an important role in conducting inflation targeting policy which operates primarily through a signalling effect.

SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID MONETARY-POLICY; RULES
AB Two alternative targets for monetary policy are considered: stability of the price level (or the rate of inflation) and stability of the exchange rate. The interest rate is the main instrument of the central bank. Credibility requires low output variability. The advantages of the alternative policy rules from the point of view of output stability are considered in the simplest possible model. Conditions favouring a price level rule are high volatility of aggregate demand, low volatility of aggregate supply, high volatility of the foreign price level, a low price elasticity of aggregate demand and a high price elasticity of aggregate supply.

DE central bank credibility; monetary policy; Indonesia; small scale
   macroeconomic model; policy frontier
AB This paper examines the role of central bank credibility in achieving an inflation target and proposes monetary policy rules for Indonesia. Towards that end, we construct and estimate a forward-looking small scale macroeconomic model (SSMM) of the Indonesian economy by adapting the theoretical underpinnings of the well-known Batini-Haldane model, along with the Taylor policy rule. Our results indicate that it is crucial for the Indonesian central bank to bolster its credibility in order to achieve a lower inflation rate. The inflation-output volatility trade-off frontier we derived from the SSMM shows that a monetary policy rule that targets both inflation and output gaps will result in less macroeconomic volatility. We also found that the inclusion of the exchange rate into the rule as an additional feedback variable warrants consideration in the future course of monetary policy management.

TI Inflation volatility, economic growth and monetary policy in Bangladesh
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS

DE inflation; inflation volatility; economic growth; Granger-causality;
   SVAR analysis; monetary policy; Bangladesh
ID MONEY
AB This article provides an overview of the trends and movements of CPI-inflation in Bangladesh since the early 1950s and examines the key issues in rule-based monetary policy for price stability, implying low and stable inflation, in this country. Under a fixed exchange rate system, inflation in Bangladesh was moderately high and volatile during the 1950s and 1960s. Since the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971, inflation in Bangladesh has remained moderately high on average and highly volatile and persistent under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system or under a managed floating system since 2003. Using data from the early 1970s or earlier depending on data availability, the article undertakes both Granger-causality and the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis with two models. The first model is comprised of such variables as inflation, the real interest rate, the real exchange rate and output growth, and the second model is comprised of the volatilities of money growth, real output growth and inflation. Then, based on the empirical findings, the article concludes that a rule-based monetary policy, namely monetary targeting or inflation targeting, remains appropriate for Bangladesh provided that it adopts a more flexible, if not freely floating, exchange rate system. The article suggests that the use of monetary policy to achieve multiple objectives under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system creates a time-inconsistency problem, reduces monetary policy credibility and makes it (monetary policy) ineffective in lowering inflation and its volatility. Low credibility of monetary policy in particular raises inflation persistence. Within the present monetary-policy framework in Bangladesh, the article illustrates how the fixed-pegged exchange rate system has generated money growth volatility in the presence of large-scale inflows of overseas workers' remittances and readymade garments export earnings. This does not seem to be a concern of the central bank of Bangladesh (Bangladesh Bank); rather, it (Bangladesh Bank) pursues monetary-base targeting to keep inflation low and stable after considering economic growth. The consequent diminishing credibility of monetary policy has kept inflation volatile and persistent, which has adversely affected economic growth.

AB This paper assesses the challenges faced by the inflation-targeting regime in Brazil. The inflation-targeting framework has played a critical role in macroeconomic stabilization. We stress two important challenges: construction of credibility and exchange rate volatility. The estimations indicate the following results: (i) the inflation targets have worked as an important coordinator of expectations; (ii) the Central Bank has reacted strongly to inflation expectations; (iii) there has been a reduction in the degree of inflation persistence; and (iv) the exchange rate pass-through for "administered or monitored" prices is two times higher than for "market" prices.

We analyze the effectiveness of intervention operations in a model of sequential trading in which i) a rational Central Bank faces a trade-off between policy motives and wealth maximization: ii) currency dealers' sole objective is to provide immediacy at a cost while maintaining a driftless expected foreign currency position; and iii) adverse selection, inventory, signaling, and portfolio balance considerations are absent by assumption. In this setting, and consistent with available empirical evidence, we find that i) the mere likelihood of a future intervention even if expected, non-secret, and uninformative is sufficient to generate endogenous effects on exchange rate levels, to increase exchange rate volatility, and to impact bid-ask spreads; and ii) these effects are exacerbated by the intensity of dealership competition, the extent of the Central Bank's policy trade-off, and the credibility of its threat of future actions.

DE Monetary policy; International transmission; Volatility; Central bank

AB This study offers empirical evidence on the linkage between the US monetary policy and Korean financial market volatilities, and the efficacy of Korea's' monetary policy in the past decade and a half. First, we find evidence showing significant effects of interest spreads between short and long term interest rates of Korea and the US, and other US variables on the volatility of won-dollar exchange rate as well as Korean stock market index. Second, we find evidence that suggests that capital inflow into Korea might have weakened the efficacy of its monetary policy since the mid-2000s, a period notable for the increased accession by foreign investors to the Korean bond market and the US quantitative easing (QE) policy. A distinct change in the propagation mechanism of monetary policy, in which short term policy rate affects long term interest rates, is observed in Korea since the mid-2000s. In the latter sample period, US monetary policy appears to have had more influence on Korean market interest rates than Korea's policy rate. In addition, we examine structural issues of the balance sheet of Korea's' central bank in view of recent rise in interests in the financial health of central bank balance sheets and monetary policy credibility in the wake of QE policies in advanced economies.

TI Comparing Exchange Market Pressure across Five African Countries
SO OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Exchange rate regime; Exchange market pressure; EGARCH-M
ID VARIANCE; CRISES; MODEL
AB This paper compares the credibility of exchange rate arrangements for the five African countries which are members of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries and will be referred to as Afro-Luso. Our working hypothesis is that credibility necessarily implies low mean exchange market pressure (EMP), low EMP conditional volatility and low-severity EMP crises under financial-market integration. In addition, economic fundamentals must account for EMP dynamics. We also seek evidence of a risk-return relationship for mean EMP and of "bad news" (negative shocks) having a greater impact on EMP volatility than "good news" (positive shocks). Using our econometric models, we are able to rank Afro-Luso countries' conditional volatility in ordinal terms. Our main conclusion is that countries with currency pegs, such as Guinea-Bissau (GB) and Cape Verde (CV), clearly have lower volatility when compared to those with managed floats and are therefore more credible. Moreover, EMP crises episodes under pegs are much less severe. We find that economic fundamentals correctly account for mean EMP in all countries and that the risk-return relationship is much more favourable for investors under currency pegs, as the increase in volatility is lower for the same rate of return. The exception to this finding is Mozambique (MOZ), which apparently has a risk-return profile akin to that enjoyed by countries with pegs. A plausible reason is that MOZ has the only managed float in our sample implementing monetary and exchange rate policy within the confines of an IMF framework, which establishes floors for international reserves and ceilings for the central bank's net domestic assets. This intuition needs to be tested, however. EMP conditional volatility, meanwhile, is generally driven by changes in domestic credit (lowers it) and foreign reserve changes (raises it). The first effect is more pronounced under currency pegs, but also under MOZ's managed float. "Bad news" increases volatility more that "good news" only in the case of CV's currency peg, which we take to be another sign of its credibility. A few striking cross-country comparisons also emerge in our analysis. Among countries with managed floats, Angola (ANG) has the most severe EMP crises, MOZ the least severe and So Tom, & Principe (STP) lies between the two extremes but closer to MOZ.

ID MONETARY-POLICY; INFLATION-EXPECTATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; PRICES; MODEL
AB The early literature on inflation targeting (IT) regime argues that adopting an IT regime in itself reduces the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). The basic logic behind this argument is that pursuing a credible and independent monetary policy will help to anchor the inflation expecta-tions and stabilize the exchange rate volatility. In this study, we investigate whether the ERPT has increased in the last decade in Turkey where the credibility of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has deteriorated and the exchange rate uncertainty has increased due to the weakening of commitment to inflation after political pressures although the IT regime has been implementing. Employing the Phillips curve model and then applying a narrowing window analysis, we have found that the ERPT coefficient increased as the beginning of the sample ap-proaches towards the last observation, especially since 2011. To search for the reason behind this increase, we additionally employed a threshold regression method following the work of Murase (2013) which allows both possibility of non-linearity in the ERPT relationship and exogenously adding the threshold variable to the model. When the gap between inflation expectations and the inflation forecasts grows, then the credibility is considered to decrease and we found that the ERPT gets higher if the gap exceeds a certain threshold. Similarly, we have found evidence supporting that the ERPT coefficient was higher when the exchange rate uncertainty exceeded a certain threshold.

AB We develop an open-economy New Keynesian Model with foreign exchange (FX) intervention in the presence of a financial accelerator and shocks to risk appetite in international capital markets. We obtain closed-form solutions for optimal monetary and FX intervention policies assuming the central bank cannot commit to future policies, and we compare the solution to that under policy commitment. We show how FX intervention can help reduce the volatility of the exchange rate, of inflation, and of the output gap, thus mitigating welfare losses associated with shocks in the international capital markets. We also show that, when the financial accelerator is strong, there is a risk of indeterminacy (self-fulfilling currency and inflation movements) although FX intervention can reduce this risk and thus reinforce the credibility of the inflation targeting regime. Model simulations match well the impact of a VIX shock obtained by local projections on a panel of inflation targeting emerging markets.

   bound; Bayesian VAR; Historical decomposition
ID MONETARY-POLICY
AB The paper presents a formal framework of money market interest rates variability under a zero lower bound in a monetary policy strategy of inflation targeting. The potential factors influencing the variability of money market interest rates are considered within a near zero level of main policy rate variability. At the same time, model optimal main policy rate shows significant volatility due to changes in the structural characteristics of economy facing deep economic and financial shocks, changing perception of inflation risks, central bank's weakened credibility and uncertainty about the efficient transmission of monetary measures. The money market interest rates are modeled in the framework of VAR model with exogenous variables using the example of the Czech economy for a period 2000-2016. The model is estimated by Bayesian method and its structural form is obtained through sign restriction. The repo rate and money market interest rates are decomposed into a series of cumulative structural shocks of each endogenous component in the model. The results show that global financial crisis and the exchange rate alternative monetary policy measures are two main sources of endogenous variables' shocks for interest rates which confirm high importance of net export, banking loans and investment for the dynamics of an open economy.

AB As a consequence of the globalisation of capital markets of all kinds, monetary policy has had to become more market-oriented, Market expectations play an important role and entail increasing volatility on interest rates and exchange rates. The latter may remain misaligned for a while compared to current fundamental indicators; although they are influenced by the latter, expectations reflect changing medium-term views of market operators. This is why central banks have to build up credibility, take a forward-looking approach and apply a careful communications policy, while they cannot rely as much as before on intermediate targets.
   At the same time, spillover effects of decisions made at a national level or of shocks have brought international co-operation to the fore. Such co-operation should not apply exclusively to monetary policy, but should also include fiscal policy, a sensitive issue for market expectations. At a regional level, there is more than a good case for establishing tight cooperation. In particular, the adoption of a single currency is a normal feature of a single multinational market. This was the vision of Robert Marjolin in as early as 1962. It was elaborated in subsequent reports, leading to the Maastricht Treaty.

SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS

DT Article
AB In the sixties of 20(th) century, monetary policy was still considered as an integral part of demand oriented economic policy, the objective of which was to achieve full employment and gross national product at the level of potential product by optimal combination of fiscal and monetary policy instruments. In that context, moderate inflation was perceived as a legitimate means to achieve mentioned goals. But supply shocks and follow-up inflation advancement in the seventies led to the. understanding of the price stability achievement and sustainability as a top-priority task of monetary policy. This change. in the economic theory main stream came up at the same time with convincing arguments in favor of an independent central bank. In its monetary policy, bank of circulation independent from politicians, electors or media has the best conditions for preferring the long-term objective of price stability to the short-term economic growth and employment increase. On the contrary, politically dependent central bank, would. be,scarcely able to face the possible pressure of the government trying to bring on a favorable political economic cycle and therefore intentions declared in the anti-inflation policy wouldn't be perceived as credible by economic entities. In the effort to ensure the credibility of anti-inflation policy, it is also possible to bind monetary policy by standing rules as an alternative to an autonomous central bank. But this approach did not acquit well either.
   The arguments against politically, independent central bank go out particularly of. the statement that it is incompatible with elementary, democratic principles when the group of non-elected technocrats disposes of large competence and, act without direct, control carried out by the parliament. This objection can be disproved-besides the existing precedent in the form of independent courts-by a mention of indirect legitimacy of a central bank. In a final consequence, it is exactly democratically elected politicians who make the decisions about a degree of the central bank political autonomy, determine monetary policy objectives and they also name senior officials of a central bank; Moreover, various empirical studies confirm the expediency of an independent central. bank for economic development of the country. The states with an autonomous central bank show besides the lower inflation rate also low unemployment, and the rate or volatility of ecomomic growth is not negatively influenced by the independence of a central bank as well.
   Following these arguments, the question of what degree is the independence of their own central bank ensured to, thus becomes very important for the citizens of present and future Member States of the European Economic and Monetary Union. For the purpose of the analysis focused on a degree of autonomy of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Central Bank (ECB), we usually distinguish between functional, institutional, personal and financial independence.
   Functional independence implies the question whether a central bank has adequate space for autonomous execution of monetary policy when trying to achieve certain objectives. In this point, it is very important that the ESCB can decide autonomously about a suitable monetary policy strategy. Very significant is also the fact that neither the ECB nor individual national banks are no longer allowed to provide credit to public sector organs and institutions. Potential limitation of functional independence represents exchange-rate policy, which falls within the cognizance of the Council of the European Union. In its execution of exchange-rate policy, the Council of the EU is indeed obliged to respect the primary objective of price stability as well as the independence of the ESCB. In the case of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), even the competence beyond the frame of the Treaty on European Union was conceded to the ESCB.
   Institutional independence is being connected with A question of the rate in which other bodies and institutions (government or parliament) have an opportunity to influence a decision-making process in the competent central bank gremium. In this context, when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by the EU Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies may seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the Member States undertake to respect Us principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks. None of the EU political representatives or the individual Member State representatives can even dispose of voting right in any decision-making body of the ESCB. The ECB is exclusively the subject to the European Court of Justice's juridical control as well as the European Court of Auditors' and independent external auditors' control.
   In the view of ensuring personal independence of the ESCB, it has to be evaluated positively in particular that the term of office for the ECB Executive Board Members is limited to a maximum of eight years and shall not be renewable. Shorter five years term of office for the presidents-of the national central banks (governors), even possibly renewable, represents kind of a risk for the independent performing of the tasks related to their function.
   Financial independence is achieved when a central bank disposes of an adequate amount of financial resources necessary for staying in a position to fulfil entrusted duties. Financial independence violation could result in a menace of either functional or institutional independence of a central bank. In the case of the ESCB, financial independence is guaranteed by the fact that the Budget of the ECB is separated from the Budget of the EU, as well as by the fact that not national governments, not the European Union, but the national central banks have provided basic capital of the ECB.
   In conclusion, it has to be underlined that there is a difference between the formal and the real independence of a central bank. Finally, general public attitude towards inflation risk determinates whether monetary policy oriented on the maintenance of price stability is successful or not. However, the European Economic and Monetary Union exists, too short to give a final verdict considering the importance that the citizens of Euro-zone attribute to a stable currency.

ID DOLLARIZATION
AB Dollarisation as Economic Solution for the Zimbabwean Demise The Zimbabwean economic and political malaise has been going on for longer than a decade and has deteriorated unabated Runaway hyperinflation reaching unthinkable proportions, an almost hundred percent unemployment rate and a shattered currency with literally no external value or esteem characterise this demise. Fiscal profligacy funded by an ever increasing fiscal deficit has played its part in this socio-economic tragedy. This state of affairs would not have been possible if the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had fulfilled its role as protector of the nation currency. Sadly the Bank slavishly accommodated the government request for printing more money and did not render any sign of independence from government as a respected central bank should have done. As in many other cases of hyperinflation, this weakness provided the basis from which the evolving tragedy gained momentum. The gigantic proportions of the continuous socio-economic and political tragedy predict an even bleaker future for the country if not attended to in a decisive way.
   No instant political or economic solution exists for this appalling situation, but economic restoration has to start with certain basic steps of economic reform. This paper suggests official dollarisation as an alternative exchange rate regime with which to clear up the economic disorder that currently characterises the economic scene. The paper explains the term "dollarisation", its features and the underlying rationale of the regime as a super-fixed exchange rate system for Zimbabwe. Thereafter the possible advantages and disadvantages that Zimbabwe can obtain from the system are highlighted, accompanied by a brief discussion on randisation as a possible alternative solution. Especially important among the advantages is the fact that dollarisation will help to restore the lost credibility of the Zimbabwean policy-makers since it will now be imported externally from an anchor country and its currency. This will not only substantially decrease the inflation and interest rates, but it will also contribute to promoting saving, investment, economic growth and employment. It will, furthermore, stabilise the dysfunctional Zimbabwean credit system, enhance long term lending contracts and correct the misallocation of resources caused by, hyperinflation.
   These benefits must be balanced by certain costs of dollarisation, especially the loss of seigniorage income, the loss of monetary autonomy and national pride, as well as the loss of the lender-of-last-resort-function of the central bank. However, in the case of Zimbabwe these costs are found to be thoroughly overshadowed by the benefits derived from dollarisation. In addition, the Zimbabwean situation and the current stance of its economy actually fit the prerequisites for a country that should seriously contemplate dollarisation.
   Although dollarisation is supported as a possible solution for Zimbabwe, randisation may also work but will have to be considered with care. South Africa is indeed the biggest trading partner of Zimbabwe and also has deep financial ties with the latter Nevertheless, the volatility in the exchange rate of the rand and the possibility of loan default on South African loans to Zimbabwe are risks in need of contemplation. Another but less credible policy alternative for Zimbabwe, is to adopt a currency board arrangement where the exchange rate of the Zimdollar is not only firmly fixed to the South African rand, but also fully (100 per cent) covered by rand reserves cis a back-up measure of credibility. Yet, under the current circumstances dollarisation presents itself as a more likely system with which to obtain rapid and trustworthy results.
   Although dollarisation on its own will certainly help, it will not pose a "quick-fix" for the Zimbabwean demise. Dollarisation can not compensate for corruption, disruptions in the social structure and a lack of transparency in the political and economic system. Furthermore, it can not compensate for a lack of human prudence in decision-making, a lack of protection of property rights and the absence of a rule of law. The latter aspects require fundamental and credible reforms on the political and juridical front, without which no economic rescue package will have any success whatsoever
